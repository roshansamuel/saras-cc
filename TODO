Measure the memory footprints of all the arrays
The Doxygen documentation in many of the older libraries (esp field) is very outdated and mentions the use of pointers where references are being used now. The docs must be updated.
Parallelize spiral LES code with OpenMP
Replace blitz::Array with standard arrays or vectors in mpidata.cc
Even more importantly, use separate sets of derived data-types and array limits for 2D and 3D cases in mpidata.cc - assuming that the datatypes created for 3D will work fine in 2D is very risky.
